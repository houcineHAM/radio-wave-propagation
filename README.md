# Radio Wave Propagation Models

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various radio wave propagation models, used to analyze and simulate the behavior of radio waves in different environments. The following models are included:

- **Diffraction Loss**: Calculation of gain/loss due to diffraction.
- **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)**: Using the Friis transmission formula to calculate signal attenuation in free space.
- **Log-Distance Path Loss**: Modeling path loss using a log-normal distribution.
- **Two-Ray Propagation Model**: Simulating the signal propagation with both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and ground-reflected paths.
- **Hata-Okumura Model**: Estimating path loss in urban, suburban, and open areas based on frequency and distance.

Each model is implemented in MATLAB, and includes reports and code for detailed analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/houcineHAM/radio-wave-propagation.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd radio-wave-propagation
   ```

3. Open the MATLAB files (`.m`) in MATLAB to run the simulations.

## Reports

Each model includes a detailed report in Word format and written in french explaining the theoretical background, MATLAB code, and results. You can find the reports in the repository.
